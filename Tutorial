**DDR deficiency tool for genomic and survival analysis in the TCGA cohort**


TCGA-DDR is a web tool which enables the users to define from 1 to 10 DNA-damage deficiencent TCGA groups and compute: 

1) population statistics across cancer types
2) survival statistics
3) genomic landscape

Tutorial for using the TCGA-DDR web tool


1. Create a group

A. Choose how many deficiency groups to compare: from 1 to 10.

In this tutorial, we are going to choose 2 groups: MMR (mismatch repair deficient) and P53 (TP53 deficient). 


B. Choose which genes define each deficiency group

A deficiency group is determined by the loss of one or multiple genes of interest. If more than 1 gene is chosen within a group, the users can also choose whether:
-the group is defined by the concomitent loss of genes (i.e. the group needs to be deficient in _ALL of the genes_) or 
-any of the chosen genes is sufficient to define the deficiency (i.e. the group is deficient if _ANY of the genes_ are found to be lost)

In this tutorial the MMR and P53 groups are defined as follow:


C. Choose which cancer types to be analyzed

Once the deficiency groups have been created, the tool computes all possible TCGA cohorts. In our case these would be:
-dMMR-dP53: deficient in MMR, deficient in TP53
-dMMR-pP53: deficient in MMR, proficient in TP53
-pMMR-dP53: proficient in MMR, deficient in TP53
-pMMR-pP53: proficient in MMR, proficient in TP53
where d indicates 'deficient' and p 'proficient'

Population statistics for these groups are shown as interactive pie-charts.

FAQ

A. How are DDR gene losses defined?

The DDR gene loss has been obtained from . Please refrain to the article for in-depth detail of how the gene losses have been determined. 
In short, the gene has been marked as lost if either one of the three conditions below are met:
1. Deep copy-number genomic deletion
2. Somatic truncating and missense mutations
3. Coupled analysis of methylation and mRNA expression data
